# flutter_bird

Clone of Flappy Bird game written on Flutter.

## Intro

This is silly attempt to learn the new mobile framework.

If you remember, there was a game called Flappy Bird. At that time it was a best time killer app. I was a fan back in days. Anyway, it is not a full clone of the game. It's just repeating some basic mechanics and graphics.

The game has built on [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) and [Flame](https://github.com/luanpotter/flame) game engine.

I haven't tried many features from standart library like Streams or even Net stack. So, I can't fully compare an experience with other languages and frameworks. Anyway, I'm looking forward to use more features in my next apps!

**Pros**:

- Dart. I didn't expect that Dart language is so easy to learn. The team did a good job for designing language. It feels like something in the middle between C# and Java, at least for me. I'm sure many others will find similarities with major languages like C-family in general, Javascript or Python. Keep in mind, it's not a coincidence. I bet, it was decided on purpose for making switch from one language to another as easy as possible. Again, good job.

- Hot Reload! It's been the main feature for selling me that framework. I have to mention that I came from Xamarin background and in this universe it's a major issue. It could take 3 - 4 min after changing some color in xamarin app. You can't be productive in these circumstances. I know, Xamarin guys have made a lot of impowements, especially Xamarin.Android team. Thank you for that.

- CLI. I have been using VSCode for Flutter and I have to admit, using CLI for interacting with the framework was a pleasure. You clearly see what you're doing and what to expect.

- UI. Many devs already said it and I'll repeat, working with UI in Flutter is awesome! You don't lean on Web based rendering (Hybrid platforms) and don't have a mess with native rendering (Xamarin, React.Native). You have just your own rendering stack, from UI elements to low-level GPU render. It this case it's very fast compare to hybrid platforms and you don't have any direct dependencies on platform SDKs and APIs (for rendering UI).

**Cons**:

I can't find any big issues with this framework... It's solid, has a great community and growing faster then others. Maybe one thing. Like I said, I haven't touch many parts of framework but, as far as I know, there is some issues with interop to native APIs. But I'm sure community will find out some cure for that.

PS: It's my first "game", so, don't judge me. I've made a lot of mistakes in architecture and code.
